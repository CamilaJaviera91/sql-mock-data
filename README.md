# 🪪 SQL Mock Data 

#### This repository aims to:

- Generate a synthetic dataset with one million records simulating employee information from a fictional company.

- Load the generated data into a PostgreSQL database using integration tools.

- Develop analytical reports using PySpark, applying large-scale data analysis techniques.

- Implement predictive models with machine learning to project trends in hiring and layoffs on a monthly and yearly basis.

# 🔥 What's pyspark?
- It's the Python API for Apache Spark, enabling the use of Spark with Python.

## 🔑 Key Features:

1. Distributed Computing: Processes large datasets across a cluster of computers for scalability.
2. In-Memory Processing: Speeds up computation by reducing disk I/O.
3. Lazy Evaluation: Operations are only executed when an action is triggered, optimizing performance.
4. Rich Libraries:
    - Spark SQL: Structured data processing (like SQL operations).
    - MLlib: Machine learning library for scalable algorithms.
    - GraphX: Graph processing (via RDD API).
    - Spark Streaming: Real-time stream processing.
5. Compatibility: Works with Hadoop, HDFS, Hive, Cassandra, etc.
6. Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs): Low-level API for distributed data handling.
7. DataFrames & Datasets: High-level APIs for structured data with SQL-like operations.

## ✅ Pros

- Handles massive datasets efficiently.
- Compatible with many tools (Hadoop, Cassandra, etc.).
- Built-in libraries for SQL, Machine Learning, Streaming, Graph Processing.

## ❌ Cons

- Can be memory-intensive.
- Complex configuration for cluster environments.

## 🔧 Install pyspark
1. Install via pip

```
pip install pyspark
```

2. Verify installation

```
python3 -c "import pyspark; print(pyspark.__version__)"
```
